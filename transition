**Otilia AI** is a virtual assistance platform powered by artificial intelligence, supporting mothers and fathers from preconception through the first 1000 days of their child's life.

## Context

Parental health today remains fragmented, outdated, and disconnected from real needs.  
While families seek trustworthy guidance, new actors — employers, insurers, and public policies — are also looking for scalable solutions.  
The consequences are critical:  
- 830 preventable maternal deaths and 7,000 preventable neonatal deaths occur every day.  
- 1 in 5 mothers suffers from postpartum anxiety.  
- 43% of women leave their jobs after giving birth.  
- Access to information remains unequal, and emotional support is often missing.

There is an urgent need for integrated, preventive, and personalized parental care.
